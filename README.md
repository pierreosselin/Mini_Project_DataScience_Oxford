# Mini_Project_DataScience_Oxford
Data Science For Development Oxford Project on the assessment of the effect of social structure on network diffusion

This project relies on the work of "Banerjee A, Chandrasekhar AG, Duflo E, Jackson MO (2013) The diffusion of microfinance.
Science 341(6144):1236498" to study stratification in network data and leverage this characteristic to choose "injection points" for microfinance diffusion.

In these networks, leaders are chosen to diffuse microfinance plans in their village. We conceived a strategy that takes the stratification of the network into account for the choice of these leaders and compare the results of this choice with the strategy paper or strategy based on centrality measures. 

# Result
Example of village where our strategy performs better than the paper or other strategies.
